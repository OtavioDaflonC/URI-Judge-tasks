# URI-Judge-tasks
These are some tasks in Python hosted by URI Judge platform and used for aducational porposes. 
It is sorted by cronological events during college only, and each exercise is identified by it's id number at URI as a comment.
I've not posted most of trivial exercises. The reader will still be able to find some.
